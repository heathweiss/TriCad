Creates a radial shape using polar cood's.

 degrees is as the max neg y axis, and rotates clockwise into the pos x axis.

For some reason, it has a slight drift. Eg: At 90 degrees, the y axis should be 0,
but it drifts off the y-axis.

Change slope and xy angle into a single Slope value.
Change radius into a Radius

Given:
cPoint : (Point-> CornerPoints)
-A CornerPoints constructor such as F1

adjustedRadius: Radius: 
-The radius, after being adjusted for slope
-Should get rid of this, and do the calculations inside createCornerPoint.
 This would simplify calling this function.
 It was used before for pattern matching, but that is no longer done.
 However, will need to pass in xSlope and ySlope, instead of just the xySlope

slope: Slope:
The slope, having already been adjusted for x/y slopes and xy quadrant

orign: Point
-The starting point which gets adjusted to give the return point. That way, this point can be created relative to some position, instead of at an origin of 0 0 0

{-
Functions for calculating the current Z plane angle. It is a combination of the slope,
and the current XY angle. It has to be calculated because the slope changes as you work around the center.
This change in slope is because cubes radiate from the center, so their endpoints will be at various slopes from the center.
When all done, they should all run together at the target slope.

It is a wrapper around slopeAdjustedForVerticalAngleBase, so that the calculation of the trigAngle only
has to be written out once, instead of in each function.
