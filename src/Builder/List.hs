{- |
Used by numerous infix functions such as (&@~+++#@) for building up a [[CornerPointsWithDegrees]].
Each layer of a stl shape is made up of [CornerPointsWithDegrees].
This Builder allows these layer to be built up, by adding another top/bottome face to the top of the
Builder list.

The 10 indicates it is based on a 10 degree spread of the radial shape.
Eg: A scan that is taken at 10 degree intervals such as 0,10..360
