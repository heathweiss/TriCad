Mirror the use of TriCad.CornerPoints +++ ++++ +++^ functionality, but with error results.

When an illegal +++ ++++ operation is performed, such as RightFace +++ RightFace, a CornerPointsError structure
is returned. This module is for collecting/viewing the errors that are generated.

See Tests.CornerPointsDebugTest for testing/examples of use.
